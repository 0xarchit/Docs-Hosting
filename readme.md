# Welcome
## ðŸ‘‹ Hello There!

This website hosts the public documentation for my various projects and technical work. I've created this space to share knowledge, specifications, and insights from my development journey.

## About the Author

I'm [**Archit Jain** (0xArchit)](https://0xarchit.is-a.dev), a programmer and student in India. I'm passionate about:

- MERN Stack Development
- Python and AI Implementation
- Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking
- Open-Source Development

As a self-taught programmer, I've learned most things through reverse engineering and online resources. When not coding, I enjoy gaming, reading tech news, and following business and crypto markets.
